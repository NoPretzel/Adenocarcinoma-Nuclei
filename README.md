# Adenocarcinoma-Nuclei
Nuclei Detection on Adenocarcinoma Cancer Histologies

>Detection and classification of cell nuclei in histopathology images of cancerous tissue stained with the standard hematoxylin and eosin stain is a challenging task due to cellular heterogeneity. [1]

A Tensorflow CNN implementation to allow nuclei detection and classification (Epithelial, Fibroblast, Inflammatory).

Super early right now.

- [x] Structure Matlab data into Tensors
- [ ] Create Convolutional Model (skeleton somewhat done)
- [ ] Train Model
